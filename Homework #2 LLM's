In your own words, describe with the tokenized description how LLMs, tokenizers, mixture of experts, and Coding Assistance fits together. 



All of these different tools working synonymously provide companies to use these LLMs to create 'out of this world' technology obtainable for the average human.
LLMs are the brain of an AI system, a collection of a vast amount of data and 'knowledge'. This is a highly complex system that is capable of generating human-like
sentences and responses. After playing around with the Tokenizer I was able to identify that its job is to break down the user input into something 'easier' for
software to understand, Unicode: 1490000 characters into integer values which aids in this process. Each word is allocated a token (number) associated with it.
The MoE comes in handy when trying to find "the right tool for the right job". For example, when asked to assist in a Java-based question, it's very likely that there
is an 'expert' in syntax, another at semantics, and even algorithms. And finally, this could all be tied back into providing computer scientists with the most up
to date technologically advanced way to keep the push for technology alive, making education that much easier. ChatGPT was able to provide me with some examples of
Coding Assistance; Code Completion, Syntax Highlighting, Error Detection, Refactoring Tools, Documentation Lookup. With all of this working behind the scenes, upcoming
programs will be able to utilize this technology and learn new languages and algorithms faster than ever done before.
